  - MAE: 0.000000
  - MAPE: 0.00%

MODEL INTERPRETATION:
- The model performs well with an R² of 1.0000
- Average prediction error is ±0.0000 CGPA points
- The model explains 100.00% of the variance in student CGPA

TOP 3 MOST INFLUENTIAL FEATURES:

1. prev_sgpa: Coefficient = 0.829332
2. academic_progress: Coefficient = 0.569408
3. attendance: Coefficient = 0.000000

CONCLUSIONS:
- The student performance prediction model is functional and provides insights
- Key factors driving student performance have been identified
- The model can be used for early intervention and student support planning
- Further improvements possible through feature engineering and advanced algorithms

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use model for predicting at-risk students for intervention
2. Focus on high-impact factors for targeted improvements
3. Periodically retrain model with new data
4. Consider ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for better accuracy
5. Incorporate additional features (tutorial attendance, lab work, etc.)
